            Transforming Our People & Society
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] font-Poppins font-semibold opacity-70 pt-5">
          Mpha Projects is socially and economically aware of the
            inequalities that may exist in our company and in South Africa as a
            whole and we are fully committed to re address these needs.<br/><br/> We view
            BEE as an integral part of South Africaâ€™s growth and development
            plan and believe BEE must be implemented in a coordinated and
            integrated manner as recommended by the Black Economic Empowerment
            Commission.<br/> <br/>As one step towards BEE empowerment, we have concluded a
            deal to transfer 26.06% Black Ownership to KDI Mining and Investec.
            It is our intention to continue supporting and developing existing
            and new BEE initiatives.<br/> <br/>We recognise that our Human Resources are
            our greatest asset. To this end, a comprehensive training program is
            in place to enhance skills, and develop talent. We encourage our
            employees to embark on a journey of self-improvement and skills
            development.
